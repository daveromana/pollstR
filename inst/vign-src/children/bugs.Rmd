# Errors

If you encounter an error when using one of the functions it is likely that there was an error in converting the data as returned by the API into data structures more usable in R.
This may happen when the Huffpost Pollster API changes, and **pollstR** has not been updated yet.
So if you encounter an error,

1. Install the latest version of **pollstR** from github and see if the bug has been fixed.
2. Try running the function with `convert = FALSE`, this will return the data as returned by the API without any of the conversions to more 
    R friendly data frames. If there is no error, then it is problem with the conversion code in this package.
    In the short term, you can `convert = FALSE`, to get the data from the API until the bug is fixed.
3. Open a new issue on [github](https://github.com/rOpenGov/pollstR/issues)
